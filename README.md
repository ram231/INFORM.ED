and simplify the workflow. The Goal of the Project is to decentralize the education system we are facing today.</p>

<hr>

## Sub Projects

- Superpowered Enrollment System with payment integration(SOON)
- Decentralized Club Organization Platform(SOON)
  - This handles the club organization including regional club organization, control of the budget from the school, and accomplishments.
- SMS & Email Updates to all sub-projects(SOON)

### Problem:

<p style="text-align:justify" align="justify">
We want our status of education to be digitalized, not stored in a university, and not stored in a tangible documents. There can be a sub-project prior to this big project. Which will be included in the future release.</p>
