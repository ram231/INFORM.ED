# Unit Testing

> :construction_worker: Due to some limitations with the framework, I have to test the components(layered classes/functions) individually.

TODO: Add Simple test to the business logic and other layers of the architecture.

Using [JestüÉè](https://jestjs.io) as Unit Testing as well as UI mock as well.

# Integrated Testing

This is my first time doing integrated Testing, and I highly doubt that this would work due to framework limitations.

I'm currently using Vuetify and Nuxt. There are no tutorials, so I have to rely on any of the documentation provided from the community.
